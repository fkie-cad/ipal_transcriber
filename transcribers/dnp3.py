# General transcriber extension possibilities through special makers/ flags:
# - object doesn't exist/ is inactive/ disabled
# - function code (/ TypeID/ Modbus function code) is not supported
# - value-format is unsupported
# - outstation is busy, but queued req/cmd
# - outstation is busy, had to drop req/cmd
# - invalid msg. format (*not* unsupported, but not allowed by standard)
# - uses reserved bits
# - uses deprecated/ obsolete bits
# - ??? Some basic authentication stuff (challenge, response, error, ...) ???
# - real-value greater than what requested format allows
#     (e.g. a true 17-bit nr should be reported as 16-bit); as in 11.6.1.1. Rule 2
# - probably could make a mini-survey about the status-codes, qualifiers, flags
#    set by each of the protocols and see which are shared across (most)
# - various types of parameters that are common but may not be shared across all protocols,
#    e.g., deadband values
# - If multiple different protocols are deployed in the same setting, it could be useful
# - outside of expected implementation level flag:
#   some devices will be set to not cover all "additional" non-mandatory functionality
#   while in DNP3, this is stated in a more structured approach, i.e., the implementation levels,
#   it could be useful to mark a packet as being outside the normal operational support of the resp. device
#   DNP3 clearly states that a stated implementation level always only sets the "minimum" and more can always
#   be supported, packets outside of the expected implementation level might be more correlated to
#   attacks, e.g., if the MITM injects pkts not supported by the IED/outstation/...


# A general issue w/ the current transcriber architecture:
#   as soon as we have an attacker who injects packets which do not correspond
#   directly to the standard, e.g., by sending a msg. in master direction which only is allowed
#   in outstation direction, the flow direction etc. will be false.
#   Since no "track record" of use of an IP/... is kept, it's not clear at all
#   what is the true direction upon such "illegal" pkt.
#   The current transcriber will just flip the direction since he assumes the pkt is a legal pkt.

# This Transcriber assumes an implementation of function codes, groups & qualifiers combinations as shown in the
# tables of section 12, ยง2:
# The standard itself allows for other combinations outside of these specifications;
#   however, since the tables provide the various baselines, these are the focus of this implementation
# c.f.12.2.:
# "
# These tables do not provide an exhaustive list of all valid DNP3 object / function code / qualifier
# combinations. Devices may implement different combinations to those shown in the tables and still use
# DNP3 in a valid way.

    # Assumes non-encrypted traffic.
    # Independent on underlying TCP/IP, UDP/IP, ... that are placed below
    # DNP3's data link layer, DNP3 deploys TLS on top if security is applied.

    # Possible global parameter which should be added for better
    # cross-dataset support: Timeout parameters, e.g., for confirmations
    # to better handle retries of the original packet which, depending on the specific packet,
    # don't need to increment the sequence nr.
    # Same goes for the #unsolicited response retries (e.g. for better handling 4.6.6 rule 12)

    # Further, if authentication is deployed, the transcriber would probably fare easier
    # if the resp. settings could be given as input since then responses can occur to
    # functions codes which would never get responses if no authentication is deployed
